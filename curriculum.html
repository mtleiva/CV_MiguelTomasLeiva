        <p>
          As a Web Developer, I have over three years of experience in the IT
          field, actively participating in various projects where I have
          utilized technologies such as C#, .NET, and REST Services.
          Additionally, I have implemented Python Scripts and worked with
          databases such as Postgres, MySQL, and SQL Server. During my academic
          training, I gained experience in working with Java. I consider myself
          a dedicated and results-oriented individual, and I am interested in
          joining a company that allows me to apply my knowledge and experience
          to contribute to it’s growth while furthering my professional
          development.
